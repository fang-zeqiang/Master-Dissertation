    "# EDA for Tech Firm's Survival\n",
    "\n",
    "## v1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "it looks as if it will be challenging to identify moving firms in the data based on past address info. Let me know if you can find any way around that. But assuming it's not an option, I'd encourage you to look at entry/exit patterns across clusters - that is, dynamics or 'churn' of firms. This will mean going back into the literature a bit help to identify a research question or questions. For example you could ask questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the differences in dynamism across tech clusters in the UK?\n",
    "What are the tech clusters with the best survival rates for firms?\n",
    "What are the linkages, if any, between firm churn / survival / cluster outcomes? (e.g. size, firm performance)\n",
    "\n",
    "根据过去的地址信息在数据中识别搬家公司似乎具有挑战性。 如果您能找到任何解决方法，请告诉我。 但假设这不是一种选择，我鼓励您看看跨越集群的进入/退出模式 - 即公司的动态或“流动”。 这将意味着回到文献中有助于确定一个或多个研究问题。 例如，您可以提出以下问题：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 英国各科技集群的活力有何不同？\n",
    "\n",
    "- 企业存活率最高的技术集群是什么？\n",
    "\n",
    "- 如果有的话，公司流失/生存/集群结果之间有什么联系？ （例如规模、公司业绩）\n",
    "\n",
    "## v2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "A/ Research question and design: as we discussed, it seems unlikely that you'll be able to identify firms that are movers in the OC data. So I would suggest shifting focus to look at 'tech cluster dynamics', especially entry / exit / churn patterns. As we discussed, if very few of the firms in your data have exited, then you'll want to focus on entry patterns.\n",
    "Based on some of the literature I suggested last time, have a think about research questions. I suggested some of these in my email from our May meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A/研究问题和设计：正如我们所讨论的，您似乎不太可能识别出 OC 数据中的推动者。 所以我建议将重点转移到“技术集群动态”上，尤其是进入/退出/流失模式。 正如我们所讨论的，如果您的数据中很少有公司退出，那么您将需要关注进入模式。\n",
    "根据我上次建议的一些文献，思考研究问题。 我在五月份会议的电子邮件中提出了其中一些建议。\n",
    "\n",
    "B/ Measuring dynamics - to recap our discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entry rate for tech cluster i, year t = firms incorporated_t / all firms_it\n",
    "- Exit rate = firms dissolved_t / all firms_it\n",
    "- Churn rate = (firms incorporated - firms dissolved)_t / all firms_it\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also try fitting these in first differences, e.g. change in entry / exit / churn between t and t-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "B/ 测量动态 - 回顾一下我们的讨论：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 技术集群 i 的进入率，t 年 = 公司注册_t / 所有公司_it\n",
    "- 退出率 = 公司已溶解_t / 所有公司_it\n",
    "- 流失率 =（公司注册 - 公司解散）_t / 所有公司_it\n",
    "\n",
    "您也可以尝试在第一差异中拟合这些，例如 t 和 t-1 之间进入/退出/流失的变化。\n",
    "\n",
    "C/ Exploratory data analysis - well done on your progress with this. You should finish up the maps you're already working on, and try building some new ones using the dynamics variables above. You can then park this and move on to regression analysis. For the tech industry LQ, I would do it roughly like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In your firm-level data, make a variable =1 for all firms, then make a dummy that =1 when a firm has any one of the tech industry SICs, 0 otherwise. That is, you treat ‘tech’ as a single industry bloc. Save/keep this as dataframe A\n",
    "- Aggregate it to UK / GB level. You should then have a national count of all firms and a count of tech firms. Then make the national share of tech firms. Save/keep this as dataframe B\n",
    "- Go back to A. Aggregate your data to your chosen area level.\n",
    "- Join B to A. Make the LQ for each area.\n",
    "\n",
    "C/ 探索性数据分析 - 你在这方面的进展做得很好。 您应该完成已经在制作的地图，并尝试使用上面的动态变量构建一些新地图。 然后，您可以将其停放并继续进行回归分析。 对于科技行业的 LQ，我大概会这样做：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 在您的公司级数据中，为所有公司创建一个变量 =1，然后当公司拥有任何一个科技行业 SIC 时创建一个 =1 的虚拟变量，否则为 0。 也就是说，您将“技术”视为一个单一的行业集团。 将其保存/保留为数据框 A\n",
    "- 将其聚合到英国/GB 级别。 然后，您应该拥有所有公司的全国计数和科技公司的计数。 然后让科技公司的全国份额。 将其保存/保留为数据框 B\n",
    "- 返回 A。将您的数据聚合到您选择的区域级别。\n",
    "- 将 B 连接到 A。为每个区域制作 LQ。\n",
    "\n",
    "D/ Regression analysis - I would suggest trying two things to start. Again, for cluster i, year t:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamics_variable_it = F(#firms_it-n, industry mix_it-n, X_it-n, location_i, year_t) (1) Firm_performance_it = F(#firms_it-n, dynamics_it-n industry mix_it-n, X_it-n, location_i, year_t) (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideally, I would run regressions for clusters based on administrative units (as you already did with regions/local authorities) and data-driven clusters, built with e.g. DB-Scan.\n",
    "- I would estimate these equations in OLS with clustered standard errors, then think about an estimator that's more spatially sensitive, e.g. GWR or something else you think suitable.\n",
    "- I'd lag the right hand side of your regressions. Try n = 1.\n",
    "- You could measure industry mix in terms of term industry share of firms, tech industry LQ or Herfindahl Index\n",
    "- How you set location depends on how you are building clusters. If you are using local authorities as your spatial units, you could fit regional location dummies and/or straight-line distance to London. If you are building them in a more data-driven way using e.g. DB-scan, you could just try distance to London.\n",
    "- X is a control vector of area characteristics. Your lit review will help you think about what should go in here. If you are defining clusters using administrative units like local authorities, you should be able to download control data from e.g. nomisweb.co.uk. If you are defining clusters using DB-Scan, I would not fit a controls vector because it will be hard to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "D/ 回归分析 - 我建议从两件事开始。同样，对于集群 i，第 t 年：\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamics_variable_it = F(#firms_it-n, 行业 mix_it-n, X_it-n, location_i, year_t) (1) Firm_performance_it = F(#firms_it-n, dynamics_it-n 行业 mix_it-n, X_it-n, location_i, year_t) (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "对此的注意事项：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 理想情况下，我会根据行政单位（正如您已经对地区/地方当局所做的那样）和数据驱动的集群对集群进行回归，例如构建数据库扫描。\n",
    "- 我会用聚类标准误差估计 OLS 中的这些方程，然后考虑一个对空间更敏感的估计器，例如GWR 或其他您认为合适的东西。\n",
    "- 我会落后于你的回归的右手边。尝试 n = 1。\n",
    "- 您可以根据公司的长期行业份额、科技行业 LQ 或 Herfindahl 指数来衡量行业组合\n",
    "- 您如何设置位置取决于您如何构建集群。如果您使用地方当局作为您的空间单位，您可以拟合区域位置虚拟变量和/或到伦敦的直线距离。如果您使用例如以数据驱动的方式构建它们数据库扫描，你可以试试距离伦敦的距离。\n",
    "- X 是区域特征的控制向量。您点燃的评论将帮助您思考这里应该放什么。如果您使用地方当局等行政单位定义集群，您应该能够从例如下载控制数据。 nomisweb.co.uk.如果您使用 DB-Scan 定义集群，我将不适合控件向量，因为它很难实现。"
